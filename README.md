# HTML5 Skeleton
> An HTML5 skeleton starter kit with HTTP/2 optimisation and Sass integrated.

The HTML5 file is saved as a PHP file in order to use the browser push script; however, if you don't need browser push you can remove this part and save the template and an HTML file.

Based on the following projects:
* [HTML5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Google Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/)
* [Get Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
